# Dragoncoin

Social experiment at SSIS for in-game currency and cryptocurrency.

## Stage 1 - on Binance Smart Chain (BSC) Testnet

This is because transfers can't be paid in the token, but must be paid in BNB. Which is real money on mainnet. Let's start simple in the testnet.

## Stage 2 - on BSC Mainnet

Someone now needs some BNB as BEP2 token (BSC chain, not BNB) to pay for any transaction of DragonCoin.

## Stage 3 - Have your own blockchain

The challenges here are big: ERC20 token? What is the network? How many nodes are planned? Decentralized? What are the incentives? Who is protecting against 51% attack and whales? Who audits the protocol?

So many questions. And will it be easy to use?

Validator app on the smartphone? 1 Dragoncoin per day if working as validator? SSIS ID needed to work as validator (RFID scan at C222 creates scannable QR code to activate the validator app?)
