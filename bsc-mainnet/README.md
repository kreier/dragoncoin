# Dragoncoin

Social experiment at SSIS for in-game currency and cryptocurrency.

## Stage 1 - on Binance Smart Chain (BSC) Testnet

This is because transfers can't be paid in the token, but must be paid in BNB. Which is real money on mainnet. Let's start simple in the testnet.

## Stage 2 - on BSC Mainnet

Someone now needs some BNB as BEP2 token (BSC chain, not BNB) to pay for any transaction of DragonCoin.
