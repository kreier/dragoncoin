# Dragoncoin

Social experiment at SSIS for in-game currency and cryptocurrency.

## Stage 1 - on Binance Smart Chain (BSC) Testnet

This is because transfers can't be paid in the token, but must be paid in BNB. Which is real money on mainnet. Let's start simple in the testnet.

## Stage 2 - on BSC Mainnet

Someone now needs some BNB as BEP2 token (BSC chain, not BNB) to pay for any transaction of DragonCoin.

## Stage 3 - Have your own blockchain

The challenges here are big: ERC20 token? What is the network? How many nodes are planned? Decentralized? What are the incentives? Who is protecting against 51% attack and whales? Who audits the protocol?

So many questions. And will it be easy to use?

Validator app on the smartphone? 1 Dragoncoin per day if working as validator? SSIS ID needed to work as validator (RFID scan at C222 creates scannable QR code to activate the validator app?)

## Legal framework

There might be some obstacles to call this a currency: See [this article from Tilleke&Gibbins](https://www.tilleke.com/insights/a-new-dawn-for-cryptocurrency-in-vietnam/). 

- **Official Letter No. 5747/NHNN-PC** dated July 21, 2017, the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) explicitly stated that cryptocurrency in general and BTC and Litecoin in particular are not legal currencies or means of payment in Vietnam; thus, any issuance, supply, or use of them as currency or a means of payment is prohibited, and subject to administrative or even criminal sanctions.
- Later, on April 11, 2018, the Prime Minister issued **Directive No. 10/CT-TTg** to agencies including the SBV, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Public Security on increasing the management of activities related to BTC and other cryptocurrencies, with the aim to control, prevent, and deal with transactions related to cryptocurrency. In response, two days later, the SBV issued Decision No. 02/CT-NHNN, which requires credit institutions, payment intermediary organizations, and SBV units to strengthen measures to control and deal with transactions related to cryptocurrency.

## Decision 942

The government issued **Decision No. 942/QD-TTg** dated June 15, 2021, approving the strategy for development of e-government toward digital government for 2021-2025 with orientation toward 2030 (“Decision 942”). Decision 942 raised a stir among Vietnamese investors as it seemed to hint at the government’s growing openness toward cryptocurrency, which to date has been largely opposed.
